# How to play:
## Singleplayer
- Use BTN3 to thrust left and BTN4 to thrust right.
- Activating both thrusters will propel you upwards.
- Land on a flat platform to clear the stage while making sure to not expend all fuel.
- Each stage will decrease the number of platforms and increase the fuel cost.
## Multiplayer
- Player 1 (left side) uses BTN3 and BTN4 while player 2 uses BTN1 and BTN2.
- Win the stage by landing safely while expending the least amount of fuel or collide into your opponent to make him crash (while also landing yourself of course)!
- First to three won rounds wins.
## Pausing and quitting
- Activating SW2 and 4 simultaneously exits the game.
- Acivating SW1 and 3 simultaenously pauses the game.
